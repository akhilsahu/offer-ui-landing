For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, the shadcn/ui library, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.
Use animation and gradient color
Also for style or css use styles directory. If they specific to component create a new sheet limit it to component

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.
Use proper directory structure and follow it strictly component and screen should be in their respective directory
ALways have screen broken down into components.
Use valid URLs you know exist.
 In any form or fields wipe out all fields in the form as and when they are closed until told to do otherwise
